The described web infrastructure is an advanced setup designed to enhance performance, scalability, reliability, and security for a web application. This infrastructure takes a proactive approach to eliminate single points of failure (SPOFs) by distributing key components across separate servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

**Infrastructure Components and Design:**

**Server Distribution:**

Each major component of the web application—namely, the web server, application server, and database servers—is hosted on its own dedicated GNU/Linux server. This separation allows for tailored optimization and scaling of each component based on its unique workload and requirements.

**Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
 
 The inclusion of a HAproxy load balancer helps to distribute incoming web traffic evenly across servers, improving response times and availability. It's configured in a cluster with another HAproxy for redundancy, ensuring that the failure of one does not impact the website's availability.

**Firewalls:**
 
 Individual firewalls for each server add a layer of security, controlling access and protecting each component from unauthorized access and potential attacks. This granular level of protection is more robust compared to a single firewall for the entire network.

**SSL Protection:**

SSL encryption is applied beyond the load balancer level, ensuring end-to-end encryption of data between the client browsers and the web application. This setup enhances data security and privacy, safeguarding against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Monitoring:**
 
 Continuous monitoring of each server ensures that performance metrics are closely watched, and any anomalies or issues can be addressed promptly. This proactive approach helps in maintaining optimal performance and uptime.


**Issues with this infrastructure:**

**Increased Maintenance Costs:**

The complexity and scale of the infrastructure mean higher initial setup costs, increased electricity consumption, and potentially more maintenance requirements. Each server incurs direct costs (purchase, hosting) and indirect costs (administration, monitoring tools).

**Operational Complexity:**

Managing separate servers for different components requires a well-coordinated operational strategy, skilled personnel, and effective monitoring and maintenance practices to ensure smooth operation.
